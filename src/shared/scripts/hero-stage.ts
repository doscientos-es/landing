/**
 * Hero storyboard: a single pinned, scroll-scrubbed timeline that turns a
 * scattered cloud of "chaos" tool chips into one finished software window.
 * The promise and CTA remain visible; the scroll earns the click by showing
 * the operational change instead of hiding the message until the end.
 * Replaces the old orbital-ring hero — the subtitle/CTA stay static below
 * the stage for the whole scroll, only the stage and caption above are
 * choreographed.
 *
 * Mobile: never runs (chaos + window are CSS-hidden, the payoff headline is
 * shown statically instead, first caption is shown). Reduced motion:
 * skipped entirely, see revealHeroStatic() in animations.ts.
